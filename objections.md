# Responding to Objections – Codex Ethica

This project, presented in our [Manifesto for a Morality Without Gods](manifesto.md), naturally raises questions and criticisms.
For the philosophical foundations and in-depth reasoned responses, see the [`philosophy.md`](philosophy.md) document.

Responding to objections is not a defensive posture: it is a way to open dialogue, clarify our intentions, and own our position.

---

## 1. Can morality really be founded without God?

This is a classic objection: without God, everything would be permitted.
But as developed in our section on [philosophical foundations](philosophy.md#1-why-a-philosophical-basis) and [moral constraint without divine transcendence](philosophy.md#9-moral-constraint-without-divine-transcendence), philosophers like Kant, Jonas, or Ogien, among others, have shown that a solid ethics can be founded on critical reason, empathy, shared responsibility, the concern for social recognition, and just institutions.
History does not show that religion systematically prevents violence—but that morality can emerge and flourish without a divine foundation.
Numerous historical examples (abolition of slavery, human rights, ecology) illustrate that major moral progress often stems from human debates, social struggles, and philosophical reflections, and not solely from divine revelations.

## 2. Does this project disrespect believers?

On the contrary. This project neither judges nor condemns any personal faith. It proposes an **alternative and common framework for public life**, freely debatable and open to all, whether believers, agnostics, or atheists.
It respects everyone's freedom of conscience and belief but does not take any particular faith as the sole or mandatory foundation for collective ethics.
As detailed in our [dialogue with religious ethics](philosophy.md#4-dialogue-with-religious-and-convictional-ethics), we recognize the diversity of convictions and the historical and current contribution of religions to morality and solidarity.
This project aims to ensure that everyone, regardless of their conviction, can fully participate in common life and public debate on rational and shareable grounds, without discrimination.
For example, in the public sphere or at school, it is about allowing everyone to debate on common and reasoned bases, without excluding or imposing any specific identity or belief.

## 3. Is this just a Western morality?

While the initiators of this project largely come from a Western context and are influenced by currents like the Enlightenment, humanism, or secularism, the ambition of Codex Ethica is resolutely universal.
It aims to be **open, translatable, adaptable, and enrichable by all**. It is not an imposed morality: it is a foundation to be discussed and co-constructed.
As illustrated in our section on [converging philosophical traditions](philosophy.md#3-converging-philosophical-traditions), we actively seek to integrate and value contributions from other cultures and philosophical traditions worldwide (African Ubuntu, Latin American Buen Vivir, Asian thoughts like Confucianism or Buddhism, indigenous wisdom, etc.). The goal is to strive for an "overlapping consensus" on fundamental principles.

## 4. Doesn't atheism or agnosticism lead to a loss of meaning?

No, unless one confuses the question of the meaning of life with the necessity of a belief in a deity.
One can find profound meaning in one's existence through relationships with others, the beauty of nature, artistic or scientific creation, commitment to justice, the transmission of knowledge, contribution to collective well-being, or in the personal quest for wisdom and fulfillment.
Atheistic or agnostic humanisms, such as those explored by thinkers like Camus, Spinoza, Sartre, or certain currents of Buddhism, offer worldviews **without divine transcendence but rich in meaning and values**.
Many non-believers engage in causes, projects, or communities that give meaning and direction to their lives.

## 5. It's too theoretical, not applicable.

All morality begins with reflection on ideals and principles.
This text does not claim to resolve all practical cases in advance: it offers a **compass and a framework for reflection** to navigate a complex world.
The [case studies](philosophy.md#6-emblematic-case-studies) and [concrete applications](philosophy.md#7-concrete-applications-and-practices) presented in our philosophical foundations illustrate how these principles can guide concrete choices in education, ecology, social justice, bioethics, or technology governance. Furthermore, the [methodology for managing disagreements](philosophy.md#10-methodology-for-managing-disagreements) proposes a pragmatic approach to address dilemmas.
A demanding but adaptable framework is better than a rigid and inapplicable dogma.

## 6. Aren't you also cherry-picking what suits you, like those who criticize religions?

The approach is different. Here, the sorting and selection of ideas and principles aim to be **rational, transparent, reasoned, and subject to criticism**. We strive to justify our choices based on debatable criteria (coherence, universalizability, probable consequences, etc.).
This framework is not presented as sacred or definitive: it is **perfectible and evolving**.
Anyone can propose well-founded modifications or criticisms, and the framework is intended to evolve with collective debate and the contribution of new reflections, in accordance with the principle of fallibility we advocate ([see philosophy.md](philosophy.md#10-methodology-for-managing-disagreements)).

## 7. Laws are sufficient, why add morality?

Laws are essential, but they do not cover the entire field of human action and are not always a reflection of ideal morality.
- Laws change, are sometimes unjust, or lag behind the moral evolutions of society. Ethics then serves as a guide to criticize and improve laws.
- Many important behaviors (intellectual honesty, benevolence, spontaneous solidarity, respect in interpersonal relationships) do not directly fall under the law but under personal and collective ethics.
This project proposes a **basis for personal ethics and a guide for collective action**, not a mere legal code. It aims to inspire conduct that goes beyond simple legal compliance, towards a thoughtful "acting better" ([see philosophy.md on social transformation](philosophy.md#11-complexity-of-social-transformation-and-the-role-of-ethics)).

## 8. Isn't imposing 10 principles already dogmatic?

These [10 principles](/principles/) (whose foundations are explained on their respective pages) are not imposed on anyone authoritatively.
They are a **proposal, an open basis for discussion**, designed to be accessible and useful.
They are **open to criticism, adaptation, and enrichment**. Their formulation can be improved, their number adjusted.
This is precisely the opposite of a dogma, which by definition is a revealed truth or imposed as intangible. Here, the approach is one of continuous co-construction, in line with our [methodology for managing disagreements](philosophy.md#10-methodology-for-managing-disagreements).

## 9. What if humans are not naturally good?

This text does not assume an innate and infallible natural goodness, but a **fundamental moral capacity**: that of reasoning, feeling empathy, understanding the consequences of one's actions, and making choices.
It is not a naive morality: it is a **horizon for civilization and a call to responsibility**.
History shows that education, dialogue, example, just institutions, and favorable social environments can encourage moral development and pro-social behaviors. Conversely, harmful contexts can foster the worst. This is why we insist on the importance of cultivating [moral dispositions and creating conditions favorable to just action](philosophy.md#the-challenge-of-moral-consistency-from-knowledge-of-good-to-just-action).

## 10. Who decides these principles? It's not democratic.

These principles, like the entire Codex Ethica project, are initially proposed by a collective, but they are **public, modifiable, and open to the widest possible discussion**.
It is not a closed authority decreeing morality, but a **proposal intended to be debated, amended, and validated (or rejected) by collective intelligence and democratic deliberation processes**.
Everyone can participate in their evolution through debate, constructive criticism, or proposing amendments.
The [methodology for managing disagreements](philosophy.md#10-methodology-for-managing-disagreements) we propose details how such processes can be conducted fairly and transparently.

## 11. Is this a new hidden spirituality?

No. This project contains no promise of salvation, no reference to an unfathomable mystery or divine transcendence as a source of authority.
It is **immanent** (centered on human experience and the world as it is), **lucid** (seeking to avoid illusions), and **assumed to be a human construction**. It is not a disguised faith.
It proposes neither mandatory rites, nor dogmas to believe, nor a closed community, but a framework for reflection and open dialogue for all, to act morally in the real world.
Everyone remains free in their personal spiritual or religious convictions, as long as they respect the freedom and dignity of others, as well as a common foundation of rules necessary for public life.

## 12. Can this text be used in schools?

Yes, provided it is introduced as a **resource for secular debate and ethical reflection**, and not as a doctrine to be inculcated.
It can enrich moral and civic education by offering clear concepts, examples of dilemmas, and discussion points, without excluding or denigrating any belief.
It can help students develop their critical thinking, their ability to argue their moral choices, and to understand the complexity of contemporary ethical issues, in addition to other approaches and teaching materials.

## 13. Isn't secular morality also subject to abuses?

No human construction, whether moral, political, or ideological, is immune to abuses or instrumentalization. History has shown that ideologies claiming to be based on reason or progress have led to excesses or totalitarianism.
This is precisely why this project insists on:
- The **transparency** of arguments.
- **Permanent discussion** and confrontation of viewpoints.
- The **constant possibility of questioning** and revision (the [principle of fallibility](philosophy.md#10-methodology-for-managing-disagreements)).
- Respect for **fundamental human rights** as an ultimate safeguard.
The proposed principles are never sacred or untouchable: they must always be debatable, criticizable, and adaptable to avoid any authoritarian or dogmatic drift.

## 14. Isn't secular morality too abstract or cold?

It is true that reason alone, understood as purely formal logic, is not enough to motivate moral action.
This is why the ethics we propose gives a central place to **empathy** (the ability to feel with others), **solidarity**, **solicitude** (active concern for the well-being of others), and **shared human experience**.
Compassion, listening, and concern for others are essential to a living and embodied morality.
This project encourages connecting rational reflection and sensitivity, for an ethics that is both demanding in its principles and profoundly human in its motivations and applications, as emphasized in our [definition of reason and our sources of moral motivation](philosophy.md#1-why-a-philosophical-basis).

## 15. How to manage value conflicts between individuals or groups?

Even with shared principles, profound disagreements can persist on complex issues (bioethics, freedom of expression, social justice, environment, etc.).
The solution is not to impose a single truth or deny the diversity of perspectives, but to organize **enlightened democratic debate**, mutual listening, the search for acceptable compromises or, failing that, respectful modus vivendi.
Our [methodology for managing disagreements](philosophy.md#10-methodology-for-managing-disagreements) details an approach based on discourse ethics, collective deliberation, democratic arbitration framed by fundamental rights, and the principle of revisability. It is about valuing the ability to adjust norms and practices according to concrete situations and evolving understandings.

## 16. Isn't secular morality elitist or inaccessible?

The proposed ethics, although based on philosophical reflections, aims to be **accessible to all**, regardless of educational level or cultural background.
The [10 principles for a just life](/principles/), accompanied by their explained foundations on their respective pages, are designed to be easily understandable and applicable.
Ethics education, popularization of concepts, dialogue, and the provision of teaching tools are essential for everyone to appropriate these reflections.
Concrete examples, case studies, and open discussion spaces are encouraged to make this morality living, embodied, and shared, and not knowledge reserved for an elite.

## 17. What about intergenerational transmission?

Religions often have proven mechanisms for transmitting foundational narratives, shared rituals, and a collective memory that binds communities over time.
A secular morality can also develop its own modes of transmission to ensure its sustainability and evolution:
- **Education**: teaching the history of moral ideas, human rights, ethical debate, and critical thinking.
- **Secular common narratives**: inspiring stories of moral figures (scientists, artists, rights activists, exemplary ordinary citizens), great struggles for justice and emancipation.
- **Civic and secular rituals**: citizenship ceremonies, commemorations of important historical events for common values, celebrations of life stages outside a religious framework.
- **Public engagement and example**: encouraging citizen participation, volunteering, and valuing ethical behavior in all spheres of society.
The essential thing is to transmit values of respect, freedom, justice, and responsibility, while cultivating critical thinking and leaving each generation the possibility to appropriate, question, and renew these benchmarks.

## 🧩 In Conclusion

This text does not have all the answers.
But it offers **a clear, debatable, responsible framework** for thinking about ethics without dogma or imposed sacred authority.

Because justice, dignity, and freedom deserve to be defended—even without a god—and because building a better world is a shared human responsibility.
