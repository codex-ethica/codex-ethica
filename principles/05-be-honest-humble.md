## 5. Be honest and humble in your quest for truth.
*Intellectual humility is a form of clarity. Admit your ignorance to learn better.*

### Foundations and Inspirations:

*   **Socrates:** The famous formula "All I know is that I know nothing" illustrates intellectual humility as the starting point of true wisdom and philosophical inquiry. Recognizing one's ignorance is the first step towards knowledge.
*   **Michel de Montaigne:** His methodical skepticism and constant questioning ("What do I know?") embody a posture of humility in the face of the complexity of the world and knowledge. (Cf. *The Essays*).
*   **Karl Popper:** Popperian fallibilism, the idea that all scientific knowledge is conjectural and potentially refutable, encourages an attitude of humility towards our theories and an openness to their revision.
*   **Confucius:** The emphasis on continuous study, self-rectification, and recognition of one's own limits to progress on the Way (Dao) aligns with this idea of intellectual honesty and humility. (Cf. *The Analects*).
