# 3. Think for yourself, challenge dogmas.
*Doubt, question, verify. Truth has nothing to fear from doubt.*

## Foundations and Inspirations:

*   **The Enlightenment:** The entire Enlightenment movement is an exhortation to the autonomy of thought.
    *   **Immanuel Kant:** His motto for the Enlightenment was "Sapere aude!" (Dare to know! Have courage to use your own understanding!). It is the call to emerge from self-imposed immaturity.
    *   **Voltaire & Denis Diderot:** Through their critique of fanaticism, prejudice, and their work on the Encyclopedia, they promoted critical thinking, freedom of thought, and the questioning of established authorities. (Cf. Voltaire, *Treatise on Tolerance*; Diderot, *Encyclop√©die*).
*   **Karl Popper:** His concept of "critical rationalism" and his defense of the "open society" imply a constant questioning of our theories and certainties. Science progresses through refutations, and truth is approached by eliminating errors. The tagline "Truth has nothing to fear from doubt" is very Popperian. (Cf. *The Open Society and Its Enemies*).
*   **Albert Camus:** His philosophy of revolt is also a revolt against conformist thinking and totalizing ideologies that deny the complexity of reality and individual freedom. (Cf. *The Rebel*).
