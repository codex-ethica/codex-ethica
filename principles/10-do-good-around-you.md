## 10. Do good around you, here and now.
*For this is where it all begins—and where every conscious act can improve the world.*

### Foundations and Inspirations:

*   **Aristotle:** Eudaimonia (happiness, human flourishing) in Aristotle is not a passive state but an activity in accordance with virtue. Acting well, exercising virtues in the city and in one's personal life, is the key to a fulfilled life. Concrete and virtuous action is central. (Cf. *Nicomachean Ethics*).
*   **Confucius:** The notion of *Ren* (仁 - benevolence, humanity, goodness) is a cardinal virtue of Confucianism. It manifests in daily relationships and concrete actions towards others. The improvement of society begins with self-improvement and just action in one's immediate environment. (Cf. *The Analects*).
*   **Voltaire:** The famous conclusion of *Candide*, "We must cultivate our garden," can be interpreted as a call to concrete, local, and pragmatic action to improve the world, rather than getting lost in sterile metaphysical speculations. It is a call to tangible engagement.
*   **Ethics of Care:** Although developed more recently by philosophers like Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto, this current emphasizes the importance of relationships, attention to others, and responding to the concrete needs of others, which aligns with the idea of "doing good around you."
*   **Pragmatist Philosophies (Dewey):** The emphasis on experience, action, and solving concrete problems in the real world can also illuminate this principle.
