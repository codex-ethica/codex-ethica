# 2. Do no harm.
*The foundation of all justice begins with the absence of violence.*

## Foundations and Inspirations:

*   **John Stuart Mill:** His "harm principle" is a cornerstone of political and moral liberalism: the only legitimate purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. (Cf. *On Liberty*).
*   **Ruwen Ogien:** Promoter of a "minimal morality" centered on the duty not to unjustly harm others, and on equal consideration for everyone's interests. He criticized moral paternalism and advocated for a secular ethics focused on preventing harm. (Cf. *Minimal Morality*).
*   **Mahatma Gandhi:** The principle of non-violence (Ahimsa) is central to his philosophy and action. It involves not only the absence of physical violence but also violence in word or thought. The tagline echoes this idea that the absence of violence is a primary condition for justice. (Cf. *All Men Are Brothers*).
*   **Medical Ethics (Primum non nocere):** Although not explicitly listed in [references.md](references.md), the principle "First, do no harm" is a foundation of medical ethics that has universal significance and reinforces this idea.
