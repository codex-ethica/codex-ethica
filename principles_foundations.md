# Philosophical Foundations of the Ten Principles

This document explores the philosophical roots and intellectual inspirations for each of the [Ten Principles of Codex Ethica](principles.md), as presented in our [Manifesto](manifesto.md). It highlights the connections with the authors and works cited in our [bibliographical references](references.md). The objective is to show that these principles, although formulated to be accessible and universal, are based on a rich tradition of humanist, rational, and critical thought.

## 1. Respect the dignity of every person.
*In every person, an equal and absolute worth.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **Immanuel Kant:** This principle is at the heart of Kantian ethics. The categorical imperative, in its formulation on respect for the person, enjoins to "treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end." Dignity (Würde) confers upon every rational being an intrinsic, non-relative, and unconditional worth. (Cf. *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*).
*   **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):** The first article proclaims: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights." This fundamental text of contemporary ethics makes dignity the cornerstone of human rights.
*   **Martha Nussbaum & Amartya Sen:** Their "capabilities" approach aims to define the conditions for a truly human and dignified life, by ensuring that each person has the real means to develop their fundamental potentialities. (Cf. Nussbaum, *Frontiers of Justice*; Sen, *The Idea of Justice*).

## 2. Do no harm.
*The foundation of all justice begins with the absence of violence.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **John Stuart Mill:** His "harm principle" is a cornerstone of political and moral liberalism: the only legitimate purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. (Cf. *On Liberty*).
*   **Ruwen Ogien:** Promoter of a "minimal morality" centered on the duty not to unjustly harm others, and on equal consideration for everyone's interests. He criticized moral paternalism and advocated for a secular ethics focused on preventing harm. (Cf. *Minimal Morality*).
*   **Mahatma Gandhi:** The principle of non-violence (Ahimsa) is central to his philosophy and action. It involves not only the absence of physical violence but also violence in word or thought. The tagline echoes this idea that the absence of violence is a primary condition for justice. (Cf. *All Men Are Brothers*).
*   **Medical Ethics (Primum non nocere):** Although not explicitly listed in [references.md](references.md), the principle "First, do no harm" is a foundation of medical ethics that has universal significance and reinforces this idea.

## 3. Think for yourself, challenge dogmas.
*Doubt, question, verify. Truth has nothing to fear from doubt.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **The Enlightenment:** The entire Enlightenment movement is an exhortation to the autonomy of thought.
    *   **Immanuel Kant:** His motto for the Enlightenment was "Sapere aude!" (Dare to know! Have courage to use your own understanding!). It is the call to emerge from self-imposed immaturity.
    *   **Voltaire & Denis Diderot:** Through their critique of fanaticism, prejudice, and their work on the Encyclopedia, they promoted critical thinking, freedom of thought, and the questioning of established authorities. (Cf. Voltaire, *Treatise on Tolerance*; Diderot, *Encyclopédie*).
*   **Karl Popper:** His concept of "critical rationalism" and his defense of the "open society" imply a constant questioning of our theories and certainties. Science progresses through refutations, and truth is approached by eliminating errors. The tagline "Truth has nothing to fear from doubt" is very Popperian. (Cf. *The Open Society and Its Enemies*).
*   **Albert Camus:** His philosophy of revolt is also a revolt against conformist thinking and totalizing ideologies that deny the complexity of reality and individual freedom. (Cf. *The Rebel*).

## 4. Dialogue to understand, unite to build.
*Mutual listening enlightens, shared effort builds the future.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **Jürgen Habermas:** His "discourse ethics" places rational dialogue and the search for consensus at the heart of the legitimation of moral and political norms. Unconstrained discussion, where only the force of the better argument prevails, is a regulatory ideal for conflict resolution and building agreement. (Cf. *The Ethics of Discourse and the Question of Truth*, *Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action*).
*   **John Rawls:** His notion of "public reason" and the procedure of "overlapping consensus" in a pluralistic society emphasize the importance of finding common grounds for agreement through dialogue between reasonable comprehensive doctrines. (Cf. *Political Liberalism*).
*   **World Wisdom Traditions:** Concepts like **Ubuntu** ("I am because we are") in Southern Africa, or **Buen Vivir** (Good Living) in the Andes, emphasize interdependence, community, and the collective construction of well-being, involving dialogue and shared effort.
*   **Hannah Arendt:** Her valuation of the public sphere as a place of speech and action, where individuals reveal themselves to one another and collectively build a common world, resonates with this principle. (Cf. *The Human Condition*).

## 5. Be honest and humble in your quest for truth.
*Intellectual humility is a form of clarity. Admit your ignorance to learn better.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **Socrates:** The famous formula "All I know is that I know nothing" illustrates intellectual humility as the starting point of true wisdom and philosophical inquiry. Recognizing one's ignorance is the first step towards knowledge.
*   **Michel de Montaigne:** His methodical skepticism and constant questioning ("What do I know?") embody a posture of humility in the face of the complexity of the world and knowledge. (Cf. *The Essays*).
*   **Karl Popper:** Popperian fallibilism, the idea that all scientific knowledge is conjectural and potentially refutable, encourages an attitude of humility towards our theories and an openness to their revision.
*   **Confucius:** The emphasis on continuous study, self-rectification, and recognition of one's own limits to progress on the Way (Dao) aligns with this idea of intellectual honesty and humility. (Cf. *The Analects*).

## 6. Be free, and defend the freedom of all.
*It is the breath of human dignity, and only has meaning when shared.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **John Stuart Mill:** His work *On Liberty* is a major plea for individual freedom (of thought, expression, association, lifestyle) as a condition for human development and social progress. He stresses that an individual's freedom should only be limited to prevent harm to others.
*   **The Enlightenment (Rousseau, Kant):** Freedom is a central value of the Enlightenment. For Rousseau, true freedom is autonomy, obedience to the law one has prescribed for oneself. For Kant, freedom is a postulate of practical reason, inseparable from morality.
*   **Jean-Paul Sartre:** Sartrean existentialism places radical freedom at the heart of the human condition ("man is condemned to be free"), implying total responsibility for one's choices and actions. (Cf. *Being and Nothingness*, *Existentialism is a Humanism*).
*   **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):** Many articles proclaim fundamental freedoms (freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, expression, etc.) and their universal character.

## 7. Confront injustice, work for an equitable world.
*Never resign yourself. Justice is won through the commitment of all.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **John Rawls:** His *A Theory of Justice* proposes principles for a just society (equal liberty for all, and the difference principle according to which social and economic inequalities are justified only if they benefit the least advantaged). The idea of the "veil of ignorance" encourages thinking about justice from an impartial point of view. (Cf. *A Theory of Justice*).
*   **Martha Nussbaum & Amartya Sen:** The "capabilities" approach (cf. Principle 1) provides a basis for identifying injustices in terms of deprivations of real freedoms and opportunities to lead a fulfilling life. It calls for political and social action to guarantee everyone a minimum threshold of capabilities.
*   **Albert Camus:** His philosophy of revolt is a call not to resign oneself to the absurdity and injustice of the world, but to engage in a solidarity-based struggle for more justice and human dignity. (Cf. *The Rebel*, *The Plague*).
*   **Figures of the struggle for social justice:** Although not all directly listed in *references.md*, the spirit of this principle is embodied by figures like Mahatma Gandhi (Satyagraha as the force of truth and love in the struggle for justice), Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and all those who have worked for civil rights and equity.

## 8. Be responsible: your actions belong to you.
*No God, no tradition can justify irresponsibility.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **Hans Jonas:** His *The Imperative of Responsibility* is a refoundation of ethics for the technological age, emphasizing our responsibility towards future generations and the survival of humanity and the biosphere. The central idea is that the capacity to act implies responsibility for the consequences of our actions.
*   **Jean-Paul Sartre:** The radical freedom of existentialism is accompanied by an equally radical responsibility. Since we are free to define ourselves, we are responsible for what we are and what we do, without excuses or external determinisms.
*   **Immanuel Kant:** Kantian moral autonomy, the ability to give oneself one's own law, implies responsibility for one's choices. To act morally is to act according to a duty recognized by reason, and to assume the implications of that action.
*   **Virtue Ethics (Aristotle):** Although the emphasis is on character, the cultivation of virtues (courage, temperance, justice, etc.) implies the recognition that our actions shape our character and that we are responsible for cultivating these dispositions. (Cf. *Nicomachean Ethics*).

## 9. Care for the world, protect the living and the future.
*Our Earth is a fragile heritage; our destiny is linked to that of all beings.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **Hans Jonas:** This is the core of his *The Imperative of Responsibility*. Faced with the power of modern technology, Jonas develops a "heuristics of fear" that enjoins us to anticipate the long-term consequences of our actions on nature and future generations, and to act with prudence and solicitude.
*   **Environmental Ethics:** This principle aligns with the broader current of environmental ethics that seeks to extend moral consideration beyond humans to the entire biosphere. Thinkers like Aldo Leopold (*A Sand County Almanac* and his concept of "Land Ethic") or Arne Naess (founder of "Deep Ecology") have contributed to this awareness, even if not explicitly in *references.md*, the spirit is there.
*   **Indigenous Wisdom and Eastern Traditions:** Many world wisdom traditions (such as those mentioned for Ubuntu, Buen Vivir, or Taoism with Laozi) insist on the interconnection between humans and nature, and on the respect due to the environment as a condition for a harmonious life. (Cf. Laozi, *Dao De Jing*).
*   **Brundtland Report (Our Common Future, 1987):** Although political in nature, this report popularized the concept of "sustainable development," defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This embodies the idea of responsibility towards the future and the planet.

## 10. Do good around you, here and now.
*For this is where it all begins—and where every conscious act can improve the world.*

**Foundations and Inspirations:**

*   **Aristotle:** Eudaimonia (happiness, human flourishing) in Aristotle is not a passive state but an activity in accordance with virtue. Acting well, exercising virtues in the city and in one's personal life, is the key to a fulfilled life. Concrete and virtuous action is central. (Cf. *Nicomachean Ethics*).
*   **Confucius:** The notion of *Ren* (仁 - benevolence, humanity, goodness) is a cardinal virtue of Confucianism. It manifests in daily relationships and concrete actions towards others. The improvement of society begins with self-improvement and just action in one's immediate environment. (Cf. *The Analects*).
*   **Voltaire:** The famous conclusion of *Candide*, "We must cultivate our garden," can be interpreted as a call to concrete, local, and pragmatic action to improve the world, rather than getting lost in sterile metaphysical speculations. It is a call to tangible engagement.
*   **Ethics of Care:** Although developed more recently by philosophers like Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto, this current emphasizes the importance of relationships, attention to others, and responding to the concrete needs of others, which aligns with the idea of "doing good around you."
*   **Pragmatist Philosophies (Dewey):** The emphasis on experience, action, and solving concrete problems in the real world can also illuminate this principle.
