# Philosophical Foundations – Codex Ethica

## Introduction

Codex Ethica proposes a universal, rational, and secular ethics, founded on human dignity, critical freedom, and shared responsibility. This project is part of a pluralistic philosophical tradition, rejecting all dogmatism and imposed transcendence, to offer a common foundation for moral reflection adapted to the challenges of the 21st century, while remaining clear-sighted about the structural obstacles to its full realization and the importance of its embodiment in daily practices. It is articulated in a [Manifesto for a Morality Without Gods](manifesto.md), [Ten Principles](principles.md) to guide action, and [Responses to Objections](objections.md) frequently encountered.

## 1. Why a philosophical basis?

In a pluralistic world, where faith can no longer serve as a unique and universally shared moral foundation for public life, it becomes essential to propose an ethics based on rational, debatable, and universalizable principles. This is the ambition of the ethics of discussion defended by philosophers like Jürgen Habermas (1992), who emphasizes the importance of reasoned debate to establish common norms. Codex Ethica aligns with this approach: rejection of imposed dogmas, but search for shared meaning; rejection of the absolute inaccessible to critical discussion, but demand for coherence; a morality anchored in human experience, autonomy of thought (the capacity of each individual to think for themselves, as Immanuel Kant emphasized in 1785), empathy (the capacity to put oneself in another's place), and responsibility for actions (echoing Hans Jonas's "Principle of Responsibility", 1979, which invites us to consider the long-term consequences of our actions). This approach is deemed necessary to ensure peaceful and just coexistence among citizens with diverse convictions. Reason, here, is not understood as a cold and disembodied faculty, but as a capacity for deliberation, informed by experience, nourished by empathy, and exercised in dialogue – a capacity whose effective exercise can, however, be hindered by unequal power relations or socio-economic conditions that limit real access to enlightened debate.

## 2. Fundamental Principles

Before detailing our principles, it is important to emphasize that these formulations, while drawing on contemporary philosophical language, seek to express profound moral intuitions. Far from being ex nihilo or purely Western creations, they aim to encapsulate aspirations and understandings that find varied resonances and expressions across many global wisdom traditions, as illustrated in the following section on ethical convergences. This approach of seeking common principles suggests a shared human quest for respectful, dignified, and responsible coexistence.

Three main principles structure Codex Ethica:

- **Moral Autonomy**: Each individual is capable of discerning what is just through reflection, experience, and dialogue. This is inspired by the Kantian idea that we should act only according to a rule that we could will to become a universal law ("Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.").
- **Minimal Respect**: All ethics begin with the refusal to harm and the recognition of the other as a subject worthy of consideration. Ruwen Ogien defended a "minimal morality" in this sense: "As long as one does not harm others, everyone should be free to live as they see fit.".
- **Extended Responsibility**: Our actions have consequences that extend beyond our person and our time. To act morally is to anticipate their long-term effects, especially on future generations and the environment. Hans Jonas, with his "Principle of Responsibility," formulated it thus: "Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life on Earth.".

These principles are not mere abstract ideals but call to be cultivated and embodied in individual and collective *practices*, which implies constant attention to the social conditions that facilitate or hinder their implementation.

➡️ These principles are detailed and their philosophical foundations explored on their respective pages, accessible via the [main Principles page](/principles/). See also the concise list of the [10 Principles of Codex Ethica](/principles/).

## 3. Converging Philosophical Traditions

Codex Ethica draws on global ethical convergence, recognizing that the quest for a just and good life is a common heritage of humanity. Many traditions, whether explicitly religious or secular, have contributed to the development of values that, once examined through the prism of rational discussion and the requirement of universalization (i.e., their potential validity for all), can enrich secular ethics. For a more exhaustive list of inspiring authors and works, see our [Bibliographical References](references.md).

| Origin | Reference and Key Figures | Key Concept / Contribution | Concrete Application (Examples) |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Ancient Greece | Stoics (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca) | Moral duty according to universal reason (Logos), self-mastery (ataraxia), temperance, citizenship of the world (cosmopolitanism). | Disinterested commitment to the service of the city, management of emotions in the face of adversity (e.g., mental preparation for difficulties), respect for natural and human laws, actions promoting universal concord (cosmopolitanism). |
| Ancient China | Confucianism (Confucius, Mencius) / Taoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi) | Relational ethics (Ren - humanity, benevolence; Yi - justice, righteousness), importance of moral education, search for harmony (Dao - the Way; Wu Wei - non-action or acting in accordance with nature). | Confucianism: Social rituals promoting cohesion (e.g., family ceremonies), moral education programs focused on the five cardinal virtues. Taoism: Meditation and Qigong practices for individual harmony, environmental management approaches minimizing human intervention (e.g., natural farming), non-directive mediation. |
| West Africa (notably Bantu) | Ubuntu Philosophy (often associated with figures like Desmond Tutu who popularized it) | "I am because we are" (Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu): Fundamental solidarity, inherent dignity of each person, interdependence, shared humanity. | Restorative justice circles involving victims, offenders, and community; community mutual support systems (e.g., tontines, collective care for the vulnerable); dialogue processes for post-conflict reconciliation. |
| Latin America (Andes, Amazon) | Buen Vivir (Sumak Kawsay in Quechua, Suma Qamaña in Aymara) and indigenous philosophies | Harmony between humans, and with Nature (Pachamama), reciprocity (Ayni), community (Ayllu), plurinationality, critique of purely extractivist development. | Inclusion of the rights of Pachamama (Mother Earth) in constitutions (Ecuador, Bolivia); community-based agricultural and forestry practices respectful of ecosystems (e.g., polyculture); promotion of local and solidarity-based economies based on reciprocity (Ayni, Minga). |
| India | Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism (varied teachings) | Ahimsa (universal non-violence towards all living beings), Dharma (natural law, contextual moral duty, cosmic order), Karma (law of cause and effect of actions). | Ahimsa: Peace and disarmament movements, creation of animal shelters, adoption of vegetarian/vegan diets. Dharma: Engagement in selfless social actions (Seva), respect for professional and family duties according to one's role and context, yoga and meditation practices aimed at inner balance and just action. |
| Oceania (e.g.) | Kaitiakitanga (Maoris of New Zealand), Fa'asamoa (Samoa) | Guardianship and protection (Kaitiakitanga) of the environment (land, sea, rivers), intergenerational responsibility, community cohesion, importance of kinship ties and traditions. | Kaitiakitanga: Establishment of *rāhui* (temporary prohibitions) for the regeneration of marine or land resources, co-management of natural parks between indigenous communities and the State. Fa'asamoa: Village consultation practices (*fono*) for important decisions, leadership systems based on service (*tautua*) and respect for elders. |
| Modern Humanism and Enlightenment (Europe, Americas) | Thinkers like John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Baruch Spinoza, John Stuart Mill, Albert Camus. | Autonomy of reason, inherent human dignity, natural/human rights (liberty, equality), social contract, reflective utilitarianism (seeking the greatest happiness for the greatest number, with guarantees for minorities), ethical revolt against injustice. | Establishment of constitutions guaranteeing fundamental rights and separation of powers; campaigns for freedom of the press and protection of whistleblowers; movements for universal and secular education; establishment of international criminal tribunals to judge crimes against humanity. |
| Contemporary Ethics (mainly 20th-21st centuries) | Figures like John Rawls, Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum, Jürgen Habermas, Hans Jonas, Carol Gilligan. | Justice as fairness (Rawls: seeking just principles for society), capabilities approach (Sen & Nussbaum: focus on real freedoms and opportunities for everyone), ethics of care (Gilligan: attention to relationships and vulnerability), discourse ethics (Habermas), principle of responsibility (Jonas). | Rawls: Advocacy for a universal basic income or progressive tax policies. Sen/Nussbaum: Women's empowerment programs through education and access to micro-credits. Gilligan: Development of palliative care and support structures for dependent persons, valorization of care work. Habermas: Organization of citizen conferences to guide technological choices (e.g., nanotechnologies). Jonas: Moratoriums or preventive bans on certain scientific research deemed too risky (e.g., human reproductive cloning). |

> **Complementary Analysis**: Ubuntu philosophy, for example, places solidarity and interconnection at the heart of morality; the Dao (or Tao) teaches the importance of living in dynamic harmony with the natural flow of the world; Buen Vivir (or Good Living) proposes a vision of socio-ecological balance alternative to purely materialistic development; Ahimsa and Dharma recall the imperative of non-violence and the complexity of moral duty which must adapt to contexts; Kaitiakitanga calls for an active responsibility of guardianship towards the environment and future generations. These concepts, although born in specific cultural contexts, offer valuable perspectives for a global ethics, once their potentially universalizable scope is examined and discussed.

## 4. Dialogue with Religious and Convictional Ethics

Codex Ethica, by proposing a secular foundation for public morality (i.e., the norms and values that should guide life in society and institutions), neither ignores nor despises the richness of religious and convictional traditions (all deep-seated beliefs, whether religious or not). On the contrary, it recognizes that:
- **Sources of Inspiration**: Religions have historically been and remain for many important sources of moral inspiration, values of compassion, justice, and the quest for personal meaning (what can be called a form of personal transcendence, an aspiration to surpass oneself).
- **Historical Contributions**: Many moral advancements have been carried or supported by religious figures and movements.
- **Internal Diversity**: There is a vast diversity of interpretations within each tradition, including progressive and reflective moral anologies that engage in constructive dialogue with modernity and human rights.

However, to establish a **common public ethics** in a pluralistic society (where many worldviews coexist), several challenges arise if one relies exclusively on religious foundations:
- **Inaccessibility to discussion for all**: Premises based on faith or divine revelation are not universally shareable nor subject to the same types of rational justification (based on arguments that all can examine and criticize) as secular (non-religious) arguments. This can exclude citizens from the deliberative process on common norms.
- **Risk of dogmatism and exclusion**: Invoking divine authority or sacred texts as the ultimate and indisputable source of morality can lead to non-negotiable positions (dogmatism), hindering democratic compromise and potentially leading to the exclusion of those who do not share these beliefs.
- **Difficulty in managing religious pluralism**: In a society where multiple religions (and the absence of religion) coexist, basing public morality on a specific tradition would be discriminatory. A secular basis aims for state neutrality and equity among all citizens, regardless of their convictions.

The objective of Codex Ethica is therefore not to replace individual or community religious morals, but to propose a **common, neutral framework accessible to all through reason and shared experience**, to deliberate and decide on the norms that govern public life. This framework allows individuals of all convictions to contribute to public debate by translating, if necessary, their convictional values into publicly audible and debatable arguments (what John Rawls calls "public reason": arguments that all citizens, regardless of their worldview, can reasonably accept as a basis for collective decision-making), aware that equitable access to this public sphere of discussion is itself an ongoing issue in the face of power inequalities. In doing so, secularism is not merely passive neutrality or simple separation, but is envisioned here as an **active condition for fair public discussion, the construction of shared citizenship, and the emergence of creative solutions to collective challenges**. It fosters a space where the search for the common good can occur through the constructive confrontation of ideas rather than the assertion of unquestionable authorities.

## 5. Tensions and Ethical Dilemmas

Fundamental principles, even if they aim to guide action, sometimes generate tensions or conflict in complex practical situations, creating ethical dilemmas (situations where choosing one moral option implies sacrificing another equally valid one):
- **Freedom vs. collective responsibility** (e.g., mandatory vaccination to protect public health vs. individual freedom to dispose of one's body)
- **Respect vs. refusal of intolerance** (e.g., freedom of expression in the face of hate speech that denies the dignity of others)
- **Pluralism vs. universality** (e.g., respect for cultural diversity in the face of practices that could offend moral principles deemed universal, such as fundamental human rights)

These dilemmas are illustrated in the following section. It is crucial to note that even an ethics based on reason and dialogue does not eliminate profound disagreements. However, it offers a method for addressing them constructively and transparently, as explored further below. If resolving ethical dilemmas represents an intellectual and deliberative challenge, the effective implementation of just action is another, equally fundamental one.

### The Challenge of Moral Consistency: From Knowledge of Good to Just Action

Recognizing what is morally right does not always guarantee that one will act accordingly. This gap, sometimes called "weakness of will" (or *akrasia* in the Greek philosophical tradition), is a constant challenge for any ethics. A secular and rational approach to morality does not ignore it. It emphasizes the importance of cultivating, beyond mere intellectual reflection, *practices* and conditions conducive to moral consistency:
- **Moral dispositions (or virtues)**: habits of thought and action such as courage, temperance, justice, solicitude, intellectual honesty, which are forged through repeated exercise.
- **Moral and empathy education**: from an early age, to develop sensitivity to others and the ability to decenter oneself, relying on role-playing and reflective *practices*.
- **Communities of moral support**: groups or relationships where individuals can discuss ethical dilemmas, mutually reinforce their convictions, and find examples through shared *practices*.
- **Institutions and social environments** that encourage and facilitate ethical behavior, rather than structures that hinder it or promote its opposite. It is about creating *structural conditions* that support individual and collective ethical *practices*.
Thus, ethics is not limited to a code of rules but also encompasses character formation and the creation of conditions favorable to just action.

This tension between moral judgment and effective action is a fundamental aspect of the human condition. Akrasia can arise from multiple factors: the allure of immediate desires, being overwhelmed by intense emotions, the weight of ingrained habits, or an imperfect internalization of principles that one nevertheless professes intellectually. A secular and rational ethics, far from claiming perfect self-mastery through reason alone, recognizes this fallibility. It insists that moral consistency is less an achieved state than a continuous effort, a practice supported by the elements mentioned: the patient development of virtues, an education that sharpens not only the intellect but also moral sensitivity, the support of communities sharing similar values, and the establishment of social structures that encourage and reward ethical conduct. It is a journey where lucidity about one's own weaknesses is the first step towards their gradual overcoming.

## 6. Emblematic Case Studies

The principles of Codex Ethica aim to guide reflection and action in concrete situations, with the underlying ambition of encouraging everyone to **do good around them, here and now (P10)**. The following case studies, chosen for their universal scope, illustrate how the other principles can be mobilized to enlighten these actions and navigate moral complexities.

### 1. Restorative Justice and Reconciliation Processes (Ex: Post-Apartheid in South Africa)

**Context**:
Following systemic conflicts or oppression, how can a society progress towards peace and justice without falling into revenge or impunity?

**Description**:
Mechanisms like Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) focus their work on listening to victims, acknowledgment of facts by perpetrators, and forms of reparation. The goal is the restoration of the social fabric and the dignity of victims, prioritizing collective healing over purely punitive justice.

**Results/Impacts**:
These often painful processes can lead to appeasement, recognition of suffering, and lay the foundations for reconstruction. A limitation sometimes raised is the perception of impunity for certain crimes.

**Link with Codex Ethica**:
Demonstrates how the quest for justice (P7) can be combined with respect for the dignity of all (P1), including perpetrators assuming their responsibility (P8). Dialogue (P4) is crucial to prevent further harm (P2) and rebuild a viable community (a form of P10 at the societal level).

### 2. Citizen Conventions for Enlightened Decisions (Ex: Climate Issues, Bioethics)

**Context**:
Faced with major societal challenges (climate emergency, bioethical questions) with multiple expertises and values at stake, how to make enlightened and legitimate decisions?

**Description**:
Randomly selected citizens are informed in a contradictory manner, deliberate collectively, and formulate reasoned proposals to public authorities, aiming for the common good.

**Results/Impacts**:
Production of often ambitious recommendations, potential for better social acceptability of difficult measures, democratic revitalization. The challenge remains the effective political translation of these proposals.

**Link with Codex Ethica**:
Embodiment of the ethics of discussion. Citizens exercise their critical judgment (P3) after information, dialogue (P4) with humility (P5) for responsible decisions (P8) and for the care of the world (P9), illustrating a collective approach towards P10.

### 3. The Defense of Public Interest by Whistleblowers

**Context**:
An individual within an organization discovers illegal or unethical practices (corruption, pollution, endangering public health).

**Description**:
The whistleblower chooses to speak out, despite the risks (professional, personal retaliation), to prevent harm or injustice. Legislation aims to protect them.

**Results/Impacts**:
Revelation of scandals, improvement of practices, strengthening of transparency; but often, heavy personal consequences for the individual.

**Link with Codex Ethica**:
Illustrates moral courage (direct application of P10: doing good despite the risks) based on responsibility (P8), the refusal of non-harm (P2) and injustice (P7). Highlights the importance of thinking for oneself (P3) and acting honestly (P5) to protect dignity (P1) and the common good.

### 4. Bioethical Debates on Autonomy at the End of Life (Ex: Medically Assisted Dying)

**Context**:
Medical advances raise questions about patient autonomy at the end of life, the role of caregivers, and the values guiding decisions (relief of suffering, respect for life, freedom of choice).

**Description**:
Variable laws and practices, reflecting deep moral convictions. Long legislative processes, involving ethics committees and public consultations.

**Results/Impacts**:
Evolution of legal frameworks in many countries, but persistence of intense debates. Difficulty in finding universal consensus, underscoring the need for tolerance.

**Link with Codex Ethica**:
Emblematic case of the limits of consensus-seeking (see section 9). Shows how different principles of the Codex (P1, P2, P6, P8) can come into tension. Emphasizes the importance of a methodology for managing disagreements (P4, section 10) which, in the absence of unanimity, aims for solutions respectful of rights and pluralism.

### 5. Universal Access to Emancipatory Education

**Context**:
Education is a fundamental human right and a lever for emancipation, but inequalities in access and achievement persist globally.

**Description**:
Policies aimed at free and compulsory schooling, support programs for disadvantaged students, teacher training, combating stereotypes.

**Results/Impacts**:
Progress in school enrollment, but persistence of strong disparities. Need for continuous efforts for real equity.

**Link with Codex Ethica**:
Education is crucial for autonomous thinking (P3), a condition for freedom (P6) and dignity (P1). Combating educational inequalities pertains to justice (P7) and collective responsibility (P8), aiming for everyone to contribute to the common good (P10).

### 6. Ethical Development and Regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Context**:
AI raises major issues: bias, surveillance, system autonomy, impact on employment, responsibility.

**Description**:
Initiatives to create ethical charters, regulations, audits, so that AI respects human rights and democratic values.

**Results/Impacts**:
Growing awareness, initial legislation. The speed of technological evolution makes regulation complex and calls for constant vigilance.

**Link with Codex Ethica**:
Highlights the need to anticipate the effects of AI (P8, P9) to avoid harm (P2), protect dignity (P1) and justice (P7). Transparency (P5) and critical understanding (P3) are vital for AI at the service of humanity (P10).

### 7. Dialogue and Values Education in the Family Sphere

**Context**:
How, within a family or close circle, to transmit fundamental ethical values (such as respect, responsibility, honesty) and manage everyday disagreements or moral dilemmas (e.g., sharing chores, managing sibling conflicts, honesty about a mistake, screen time usage)?

**Description**:
Rather than imposing rules authoritatively, family members strive to establish dialogue (P4) based on listening and mutual respect (P1). Children or adolescents are encouraged to think for themselves (P3) about the consequences of their actions for themselves and others (P2, P8). Honesty (P5) is valued, and just and equitable solutions to conflicts are sought together (P7).

**Results/Impacts**:
Development of moral autonomy, empathy, and a sense of responsibility in young people. Strengthening of family ties based on trust and mutual understanding. Learning constructive disagreement management.

**Link with Codex Ethica**:
Illustrates that the principles of Codex Ethica are not reserved for major public issues but can structure interpersonal relationships and moral education from an early age. The application of principles such as respect for dignity (P1), non-harm (P2), autonomous thinking (P3), dialogue (P4), honesty (P5), justice (P7), and responsibility (P8) in this framework is a concrete way to "do good around oneself, here and now" (P10) and to prepare individuals to be enlightened and responsible citizens.

## 7. Concrete Applications and Practices

Beyond major case studies, the principles of Codex Ethica find their meaning and vitality in their application to specific domains and in their embodiment in *daily practices*, both individual and collective. Here are some illustrations:

- **Education**: Teaching and *practice* of ethical debate, critical thinking, and respect for others from school onwards (UNESCO, 2015), ensuring that *school structures* themselves do not reproduce the inequalities they claim to combat.
- **Public Policies**: Consideration of long-term impact (precautionary principle, intergenerational justice), ensuring that *decision-making processes* are transparent and not unduly influenced by private interests that constitute *structural obstacles* to the general interest.
- **Businesses**: Development of authentic corporate social and environmental responsibility (CSR) *practices*, transparency, fight against corruption, going beyond declarations of intent to question underlying *governance structures* and economic models.
- **Technologies**: Ethical framework for AI, respect for privacy, promotion of digital inclusion *practices* (Montreal Declaration for a Responsible AI, 2018), while analyzing how *technology ownership and control structures* can exacerbate inequalities.

## 8. Responses to Objections

This section aims to synthesize and elaborate on some common objections to the Codex Ethica project, drawing on previous developments. For a more exhaustive exploration, the document [`objections.md`](objections.md) can be consulted. Here are some key elements:

- **Is an ethics without divine foundation sufficiently binding?** Yes. As we have seen (notably in section 9), moral constraint does not necessarily come from an external authority (heteronomous morality, where rules are received without critical examination). It can emerge from:
    - **Critical reason**: concern for self-consistency and the ability to universalize one's principles of action.
    - **Empathy**: the ability to identify with others and feel their joys or sorrows.
    - **Social recognition**: the desire to be esteemed by one's peers and the justified fear of blame for harmful actions.
    - **Shared responsibility**: awareness of the consequences of our actions on the community and the future.
    - The existence of **just institutions** that frame and support ethical behavior (as proposed by Habermas).
    These motivations, intrinsic (coming from the individual) and relational (born from interaction with others), found a **mature moral autonomy** (where the individual adheres to rules through understanding and inner conviction). Motivation is then not simply a matter of "fear of sin or hope of paradise," but a reflective adherence to values recognized as just and necessary for "living well together."

- **Isn't this project a disguised Western morality?** No. Although initiated in a context influenced by the European Enlightenment, it explicitly integrates, as detailed in section 3, global philosophical and ethical traditions. The objective is to find what philosopher John Rawls calls an "overlapping consensus": an agreement on fundamental principles of justice among citizens with different worldviews (philosophical, religious, moral) who can nevertheless agree on these principles for publicly shareable reasons. It is an approach of intercultural dialogue and search for convergences, not an imposition.

- **Can we really establish a common foundation without a great transcendent collective narrative (that goes beyond ordinary human experience)?** Yes. The "great narrative" can be the very human one of the continuous construction of a more just society, founded on the dignity of each person and collective responsibility towards others and the planet. The proposed foundation rests on debatable principles that can be shared after rational examination, allowing for open dialogue and voluntary adherence rather than imposed faith. Philosophers like Martha Nussbaum (2006), by developing the "capabilities" approach (the real opportunities for each person to live a dignified life), show how to found social justice on rational and universally defensible bases, as mentioned earlier.

## 9. Moral Constraint Without Divine Transcendence

To act morally without relying on divine authority is to respond to the call of reason (our capacity to judge and argue), empathy (our ability to feel with others), social recognition (our need to be accepted and respected within a community), and shared responsibility (the awareness that our actions have an impact on others and in the long term). Moral constraint therefore indeed exists outside a religious framework: it is internal (the voice of conscience, concern for personal coherence), social (the pressure of others' gaze, collective reprobation or approval), and institutional (laws and rules of justice that structure society). This model undoubtedly requires more individual and collective maturity, as well as constant dialogue, but it founds a living ethics, capable of adapting to human diversity and new challenges.

- **Sources of motivation**: reason, empathy, need for social recognition, sense of responsibility, anticipation of the consequences of one's actions, desire for justice.
- **Sanctions (in the broad sense, including consequences)**: feelings of guilt or remorse (moral conscience), social disapproval (blame, ostracism), legal or regulatory sanctions (provided by institutions).

### Limits and Safeguards in the Face of Persistent Disagreements

It is essential to recognize that, even with the most rigorous methodology, some moral disagreements can prove to be particularly profound and persistent, touching upon worldviews that are difficult to reconcile (e.g., on issues such as the status of the embryo, certain implications of new technologies, or the very definition of "the good life"). In such cases, where consensus or even compromise seem out of reach, the ethics of discussion reaches its practical limits.

It is then that the **democratic framework and the rule of law**, founded on the intransgressible respect for **fundamental human rights**, play a crucial role of last resort. These rights (freedom of conscience, equality before the law, dignity of the person, prohibition of inhuman treatment, etc.) constitute a non-negotiable foundation that protects individuals and minorities, even when the majority adopts laws or policies that offend their deep convictions. The democratic decision, although imperfect, then becomes the legitimate mechanism for settling matters, while guaranteeing the possibility of continuing the debate and revising decisions in the future.

However, it should be acknowledged with humility that even this recourse to the democratic framework and fundamental rights cannot extinguish all sources of profound moral disagreement. For questions touching on the intimacy of convictions about the meaning of life, death, or human nature, cleavages may persist, creating lasting tensions within society. Codex Ethica, as a rational and dialogical approach, does not claim to hold the key to perfect and definitive social harmony. Its ambition is rather to provide the tools to manage these disputes in the most respectful and least destructive way possible, by keeping open the channels of dialogue and protecting the rights of everyone, including the right to express and live according to one's deep convictions, within the limits of respect for those of others. It is then less a matter of eliminating disagreement than of learning to "live with it" in a civilized manner, accepting a degree of irresolution as constitutive of a pluralistic society.

- **Examples of application**: bioethical debates (on end-of-life, medically assisted procreation), citizen consultation processes for projects with major environmental impact, development of ethical charters for artificial intelligence, protection of personal data.

## 10. Methodology for Managing Disagreements

Even within a secular and rational ethical framework, disagreements on specific moral issues are inevitable and even desirable, as they testify to the vitality of democratic debate. Codex Ethica does not claim to offer ready-made solutions, but a methodology for approaching these conflicts, drawing inspiration notably from Habermas's **ethics of discussion**:

- **Principles of rational discussion**: The search for legitimate norms involves a discussion where the following prevail:
    - The **force of the better argument** (and not authority or status – an ideal that must constantly be defended against *distortions induced by power relations*).
    - The **absence of coercion** (everyone must be able to express themselves freely, which presupposes *social and political conditions guaranteeing this freedom*).
    - The **equality of participants** (each voice has the same a priori weight, a principle that clashes with *structural inequalities in access to speech and information*).
    - The **sincere will to reach a consensus** or, failing that, a fair compromise.
    This implies the ability to decenter oneself (step out of one's own point of view) and consider the perspectives of others, *practices* that can be actively cultivated.
- **Informed collective deliberation**: The organization of citizen forums, consensus conferences, citizen juries, and public debates must be enlightened by diverse and contradictory expertise, so that participants can form an informed judgment. Transparency of arguments and effective consideration of minority voices are essential.
- **Democratic arbitration and respect for fundamental rights**: When consensus is impossible, the majority decision can prevail within a democratic framework. However, this decision must always be framed by the intransgressible respect for the fundamental rights of each person (freedom of conscience, equality, dignity, etc.). Appeal mechanisms and independent institutions (such as constitutional courts or ombudsmen) must ensure fairness and protection against a possible "tyranny of the majority."
- **Principle of fallibility and revisability** (sometimes called "epistemic humility": the awareness that our knowledge is limited and potentially erroneous): Any norm or decision resulting from this process must be considered potentially revisable in light of new information, experiences, or arguments. A learning society is a society that accepts to question its own conclusions.
- **Examples of application**: bioethical debates (on end-of-life, medically assisted procreation), citizen consultation processes for projects with major environmental impact, development of ethical charters for artificial intelligence, protection of personal data.

## 11. Complexity of Social Transformation and the Role of Ethics

Individual adoption of ethical principles, however fundamental, is not in itself sufficient to guarantee positive and sustainable social transformation. Codex Ethica recognizes that:
- **Structures influence behavior**: Economic, political, legal, and social systems (the "structures," *often marked by deep inequalities and historically constituted power relations*) exert considerable influence on individuals' choices and actions. Social transformation therefore requires structural and institutional changes, not just individual moral "conversion" or isolated *practices*.
- **Power relations are decisive**: Inequalities of power (economic, political, symbolic – related to prestige or recognition) can hinder the implementation of ethical principles, even if widely shared in theory. The fight for social justice and the democratization of power are therefore inseparable from a consistent ethical approach, which must tackle these *structural obstacles*.
- **Ethics informs collective action**: While not sufficient on its own, shared ethics nevertheless provides a vision, motivation, and criteria for collective action and institutional reform, in order to transform the *structural conditions* that generate injustice. It inspires social movements (such as those for civil rights or ecology), guides the development of laws, and directs public policies.
- **Dialectical interaction (reciprocal influence)**: There is a constant and dynamic interaction between individual ethical convictions (what people believe and value, often expressed through their *practices*), collective mobilizations (how they organize and act together), and structural evolutions (changes in laws, institutions, the economy). Changes in mentality, *alternative practices*, and individual actions can initiate and support movements that, in the long run, favor institutional reforms. Conversely, fairer institutions and equitable laws can encourage and facilitate the adoption of more ethical behaviors and *practices* on a large scale.

Thus, the role of Codex Ethica is to provide an ethical framework that can both:
- Guide **individual conduct** and the formation of personal moral judgment, by offering benchmarks for reflecting on one's own choices, responsibilities, and *daily practices*.
- Inspire and legitimize **collective action** with a view to structural reforms aimed at a more just society, more respectful of dignities, and more ecologically and socially sustainable. It is about recognizing that while personal ethics, *lived as a practice*, is indispensable, it takes on its full meaning when articulated with a commitment to transform the *structural conditions* that produce injustice or degradation.

## 12. Conclusion & Synthesis

Codex Ethica is an invitation to build, collectively and individually, a moral framework that is both ambitious in its universalist aspiration and humble in its awareness of the complexities of the world and human nature. It is not a closed doctrine, but an open platform for ongoing reflection and action, nourished by the richness of philosophical traditions and the urgency of contemporary challenges.

It proposes to:
- **Anchor ethics in reason and shared human experience**, rather than in dogmas or transcendent revelations, to foster autonomous and responsible moral judgment.
- **Promote ten core principles** – respect for dignity, non-harm, critical thinking, dialogue, honesty, freedom, justice, responsibility, care for the world, and doing good – as a compass for individual and collective action.
- **Recognize the value of converging ethical insights** from diverse global philosophical and wisdom traditions, encouraging intercultural dialogue.
- **Engage in a constructive dialogue with religious and convictional ethics**, proposing a secular framework for public morality that allows for the participation of all citizens.
- **Provide a methodology for addressing ethical dilemmas and disagreements**, based on rational discussion, informed deliberation, and respect for fundamental rights.
- **Articulate individual ethics with the need for social and structural transformation**, acknowledging that personal commitment and collective action are both necessary to create a more just and sustainable world.

This endeavor requires lucidity about obstacles, perseverance in effort, and confidence in the human capacity to progress, through dialogue and shared commitment, towards a common good that respects the freedom and dignity of each person. It is a path of continuous learning and adaptation, where ethical reflection is not an abstract exercise, but a vital practice for navigating the challenges of our time and building a future worthy of being lived.
