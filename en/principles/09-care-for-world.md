# 9. Care for the world, protect the living and the future.
*Our Earth is a fragile heritage; our destiny is linked to that of all beings.*

## Foundations and Inspirations:

*   **Hans Jonas:** This is the core of his *The Imperative of Responsibility*. Faced with the power of modern technology, Jonas develops a "heuristics of fear" that enjoins us to anticipate the long-term consequences of our actions on nature and future generations, and to act with prudence and solicitude.
*   **Environmental Ethics:** This principle aligns with the broader current of environmental ethics that seeks to extend moral consideration beyond humans to the entire biosphere. Thinkers like Aldo Leopold (*A Sand County Almanac* and his concept of "Land Ethic") or Arne Naess (founder of "Deep Ecology") have contributed to this awareness, even if not explicitly in *references.md*, the spirit is there.
*   **Indigenous Wisdom and Eastern Traditions:** Many world wisdom traditions (such as those mentioned for Ubuntu, Buen Vivir, or Taoism with Laozi) insist on the interconnection between humans and nature, and on the respect due to the environment as a condition for a harmonious life. (Cf. Laozi, *Dao De Jing*).
*   **Brundtland Report (Our Common Future, 1987):** Although political in nature, this report popularized the concept of "sustainable development," defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This embodies the idea of responsibility towards the future and the planet.
