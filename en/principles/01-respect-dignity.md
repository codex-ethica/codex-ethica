# 1. Respect the dignity of every person.
*In every person, an equal and absolute worth.*

## Foundations and Inspirations:

*   **Immanuel Kant:** This principle is at the heart of Kantian ethics. The categorical imperative, in its formulation on respect for the person, enjoins to "treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end." Dignity (WÃ¼rde) confers upon every rational being an intrinsic, non-relative, and unconditional worth. (Cf. *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*).
*   **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):** The first article proclaims: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights." This fundamental text of contemporary ethics makes dignity the cornerstone of human rights.
*   **Martha Nussbaum & Amartya Sen:** Their "capabilities" approach aims to define the conditions for a truly human and dignified life, by ensuring that each person has the real means to develop their fundamental potentialities. (Cf. Nussbaum, *Frontiers of Justice*; Sen, *The Idea of Justice*).
