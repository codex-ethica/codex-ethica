# 8. Be responsible: your actions belong to you.
*No God, no tradition can justify irresponsibility.*

## Foundations and Inspirations:

*   **Hans Jonas:** His *The Imperative of Responsibility* is a refoundation of ethics for the technological age, emphasizing our responsibility towards future generations and the survival of humanity and the biosphere. The central idea is that the capacity to act implies responsibility for the consequences of our actions.
*   **Jean-Paul Sartre:** The radical freedom of existentialism is accompanied by an equally radical responsibility. Since we are free to define ourselves, we are responsible for what we are and what we do, without excuses or external determinisms.
*   **Immanuel Kant:** Kantian moral autonomy, the ability to give oneself one's own law, implies responsibility for one's choices. To act morally is to act according to a duty recognized by reason, and to assume the implications of that action.
*   **Virtue Ethics (Aristotle):** Although the emphasis is on character, the cultivation of virtues (courage, temperance, justice, etc.) implies the recognition that our actions shape our character and that we are responsible for cultivating these dispositions. (Cf. *Nicomachean Ethics*).
