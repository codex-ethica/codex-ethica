# 6. Be free, and defend the freedom of all.
*It is the breath of human dignity, and only has meaning when shared.*

## Foundations and Inspirations:

*   **John Stuart Mill:** His work *On Liberty* is a major plea for individual freedom (of thought, expression, association, lifestyle) as a condition for human development and social progress. He stresses that an individual's freedom should only be limited to prevent harm to others.
*   **The Enlightenment (Rousseau, Kant):** Freedom is a central value of the Enlightenment. For Rousseau, true freedom is autonomy, obedience to the law one has prescribed for oneself. For Kant, freedom is a postulate of practical reason, inseparable from morality.
*   **Jean-Paul Sartre:** Sartrean existentialism places radical freedom at the heart of the human condition ("man is condemned to be free"), implying total responsibility for one's choices and actions. (Cf. *Being and Nothingness*, *Existentialism is a Humanism*).
*   **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):** Many articles proclaim fundamental freedoms (freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, expression, etc.) and their universal character.
