# Manifesto – For a Morality Without Gods

---

## 1. Why an ethics without religion is not only possible, but necessary for peaceful coexistence

Throughout its history, humanity has forged fundamental tools to shape its future: critical reason, the scientific approach, wisdom drawn from shared experience, and the vitality of public debate.
These human foundations are sufficient to **collectively build a solid, just, and responsible morality**, capable of guiding our pluralistic societies without invoking divine tutelage.

To enlighten our choices, the teachings of a distant past, often contradictory or biased, are no longer sufficient.
Today, we indispensably need clarity in discernment, rigor in principles, and courage in facing our responsibilities.
And this ethics of today, **it is up to us, collectively, to construct it** (for an exploration of these foundations, see our [philosophical approach](philosophy.md)), in the wake of all those who, from the Enlightenment to the present day, have affirmed the primacy of human conscience.

## 2. The limits and contributions of religious foundations of morality

Great religious traditions have undeniably marked history, offering guidance to billions of individuals. However, their foundational texts bear the imprint of bygone eras. We still read in them:

- The legitimation of slavery,
- The assignment of women to an inferior status,
- The condemnation of homosexuality,
- The call to war in the name of God, or the justification of cruel punishments.

Today, many believers approach these legacies with a fresh perspective, prioritizing spirit over letter. Nevertheless, **the dogma of the sacredness of these writings remains a powerful brake: it hinders collective questioning and delays urgent moral advancements.** A text elevated to an absolute naturally resists evolution.

It must be said forcefully: religions have also been vibrant sources of moral inspiration, nurturing solidarity, the quest for justice, and the defense of the most vulnerable. Even today, many believers are committed actors in human progress, upholding values of freedom and responsibility.

The history of moral progress, as highlighted by lucid minds like **Steven Pinker** or **Yuval Noah Harari**, is not, however, one of revelations fallen from the sky. Abolition of slavery, affirmation of human rights, the march towards equality, ecological awareness: these conquests are the fruit of **struggles led by women and men, critical reflections, and courageous civic mobilizations.**

Ultimately, a morality based solely on the fear of divine judgment or the hope of a hypothetical afterlife **misses its mark: it cultivates submission where responsibility should flourish.** An ethics worthy of the name is a free and assumed choice.
Faced with injustice or arbitrariness, as **Albert Camus** reminded us, human beings are ennobled not by submission, but by revolt in the name of justice.

## 3. A clear alternative: reason, respect, and responsibility

Faced with the impasses of yesterday, we affirm the vitality of an ethics accessible to every conscience, built on three inseparable pillars:

- **Unconditional respect for others**: recognizing in every human being an equal dignity, regardless of their convictions, identity, or background. An ethics that, with **Immanuel Kant**, sees others never merely as a means, but always as an end in themselves.

- **Personal freedom, bordered by non-harm**: allowing everyone to chart their own life path, as long as their freedom does not impede that of others or cause them harm. This is the spirit of the "minimal ethics" advocated by **Ruwen Ogien**.

- **Expanded responsibility, for today and for tomorrow**: becoming aware that our actions, individual and collective, shape the future of the human community and the planet. This is a lucid responsibility, not before a divine authority, but **before the living and the generations that will follow us**. It echoes **Hans Jonas'** warnings about our duty towards the future and the work of **Ulrich Beck** or **Uwe Schneidewind** on the ecological emergency.

This ethics aims to be **secular, open to debate, and constantly evolving**. It does not promise salvation; it calls for lucid effort. It does not seek submission; it aims for responsible autonomy.
It aligns with the **"capabilities" perspective cherished by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum**: working to ensure that every person has the real means to lead a dignified and chosen life, free from any dogmatic hindrance to their essential rights.

## 4. From individual morality to social transformation

A lived ethics is never a solitary act; it carries within it the power to transform the world.
History teaches us: major institutional achievements – the abolition of slavery, equality of rights, recognition of new freedoms – often arise from a groundswell, an awareness that first matures in minds and hearts, individually and collectively.

This is why, by actively embodying an ethics of reason, respect, and responsibility, each of us becomes an essential link in a chain of change. Our actions, our words, our commitments contribute, through positive contagion, to shifting mentalities, inspiring new social norms, and ultimately shaping fairer laws and institutions.

Examples abound: from women's suffrage to marriage for all, from the end of segregation to the prohibition of the death penalty in many countries, it was first citizen convictions, civil society movements, that paved the way for legislators.
Thus, the rise and sharing of a secular morality, founded on argumentation and mutual respect, constitute a powerful lever for profound, desirable, and sustainable social progress.

## 5. Ten Principles for a Just Life

As a shared, adaptable, and easily transmissible foundation, we propose these ten principles:

These guidelines do not claim any particular belief and do not aim to impose themselves on anyone.
Everyone can appropriate them, nourish them with their reflection, disseminate them, and adjust them to their own measure.
They are intended as a **compass to enlighten our steps, here and now, with discernment, integrity, and resolve.**

## 6. For an ethics of dialogue and openness

Rejecting dogmas in no way means rejecting others.
It is to aspire to a society **where the cement of public values is forged in the crucible of debate, not in the silence of adoration.**

We recognize the plurality of convictions and the historical contribution of spiritual traditions. Nevertheless, a truly inclusive community requires a common ethical foundation, anchored in reason, mutual respect, and freedom of conscience.

This is why we invite every person, whether they claim a faith or none, to enrich this dialogue (see also our [response to common objections](objections.md)) and to work together on this shared ethics, the foundation of a more equitable, welcoming, and resolutely future-oriented society.

## 7. An ethical society without gods: a feasible perspective

No need for transcendence to aspire to good and implement it.
We need the clear-sightedness of conscience, the richness of dialogue, the rigor of thought, and the nobility of mutual expectation.

A society that honors all convictions, but **which anchors its laws in shared reason, not in faith alone.**
Such a society, guided by a secular ethics, **is within our reach.**

It comes into being **as soon as justice, fairness, and concern for others become everyone's business, a fully human responsibility.**
