# üì¢ Manifesto ‚Äì For a Morality Without Gods

---

## 1. Why an ethics without religion is not only possible, but necessary

In modern societies, we possess the intellectual, scientific, and social tools to build **a robust morality without appealing to divine authority**. Human experience, reason (as Kant emphasized), dialogue, and the observation of the world are sufficient to determine what is fair, just, and sustainable.

We do not need ancient, contradictory, violent or arbitrary scriptures to guide our lives.  
We need clarity, consistency, and responsibility. And these, **we can construct ourselves**, as the Enlightenment philosophers already argued.

## 2. The limits of religious morality

Religious scriptures were written in historical contexts very different from ours. They include:

- Justifications for slavery  
- Legal and moral inferiority of women  
- Condemnation of homosexuality  
- Holy war, corporal punishment, and divine vengeance

Even when believers interpret these texts in a symbolic or moderate way today, **the foundations remain fragile**: a sacred text is, by definition, hard to question. This slows down moral progress ‚Äî or blocks it entirely.

As thinkers like **Steven Pinker** or **Yuval Noah Harari** have shown, modern moral achievements (human rights, abolition, democracy, ecological awareness) stem from **human struggles and civic debate**, not from divine revelation.

Basing ethics on the fear of sin or the hope of paradise replaces responsibility with submission.  
That is not morality ‚Äî it is **spiritual blackmail**, as **Albert Camus** denounced in *The Rebel*.

## 3. A clear alternative: reason, respect, and responsibility

We can build a robust ethical framework based on three core principles:

- **Respect for others**: recognizing the dignity of every individual, regardless of belief, origin, or identity. This echoes Kant‚Äôs view of moral autonomy and of others as ends in themselves.

- **Personal freedom**: as long as it harms no one, each person should live according to their values. This follows **Ruwen Ogien‚Äôs ‚Äúminimal ethics‚Äù**: do not impose your morals, but take full responsibility for your own.

- **Collective responsibility**: our actions affect others and future generations. Acting with lucidity and sustainability means being accountable not before a god, but **before the living and those who come after us**.  
  This is in line with **Hans Jonas‚Äô ethics of responsibility** and the work of **Ulrich Beck** or **Uwe Schneidewind** on risk societies and ecological transition.

This morality is **secular, evolving, and reasoned**. It does not promise salvation, but demands effort. It does not seek to control, but to empower.

It also resonates with the **capabilities approach** (Sen & Nussbaum): enabling everyone to live with dignity and freedom, without any belief system limiting their fundamental rights.

## 4. Ten Principles for a Just Life

We propose a simple, open, and shareable ethical foundation:

‚û°Ô∏è [See the 10 principles](principles.md)

These principles are not based on faith.  
They are not imposed.  
But they offer those who do not believe ‚Äî and those who doubt ‚Äî a **moral compass** grounded in dignity, freedom, and responsibility.

## 5. A humanist ethics for a free world

We do not need belief to act ethically.  
We need **conscience, dialogue, honesty and courage**.

To reject dogma is not to reject others.  
It is to build a society **where values emerge from debate ‚Äî not adoration.**

A society that respects believers ‚Äî  
but does **not base its laws on faith**.

**A moral world without gods is possible.**  
And it begins **when justice becomes a human responsibility, not a divine one.**
