# The Principles of Codex Ethica

This page outlines the core ethical principles that form the foundation of Codex Ethica. Each principle is further explored with its philosophical underpinnings on its dedicated page.

Our principles are living guidelines, intended to foster reflection and guide action in the development and use of technology.
