# ðŸ“œ Ten Principles for a Morality Without Gods

*A morality without dogma. A humanism without illusion.*

---

## 1. Respect the dignity of every person  
Every human being deserves consideration, without condition.

## 2. Do no harm  
Justice begins with the refusal of violence.

## 3. Be free, and defend the freedom of others  
Freedom only has meaning if it is shared.

## 4. Think for yourself  
Doubt, question, verify â€” this is the foundation of moral autonomy.

## 5. Challenge easy certainties  
Truth has nothing to fear from doubt.

## 6. Be honest about what you know, and humble about what you don't  
Intellectual humility is a form of clarity.

## 7. Be responsible: your actions belong to you  
No god, no tradition can excuse your irresponsibility.

## 8. Support the most vulnerable  
Justice begins where we protect those who cannot defend themselves.

## 9. Protect the planet, all living beings, and future generations  
Our world is a fragile legacy â€” not an infinite resource.

## 10. Do good around you, here and now  
Because this is where it all begins â€” and where everything can improve.
