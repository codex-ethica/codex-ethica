## 1. Respect the dignity of every person.
*In every person, an equal and absolute worth.*

## 2. Do no harm.
*The foundation of all justice begins with the absence of violence.*

## 3. Think for yourself, challenge dogmas.
*Doubt, question, verify. Truth has nothing to fear from doubt.*

## 4. Dialogue to understand, unite to build.
*Mutual listening enlightens, shared effort builds the future.*

## 5. Be honest and humble in your quest for truth.
*Intellectual humility is a form of clarity. Admit your ignorance to learn better.*

## 6. Be free, and defend the freedom of all.
*It is the breath of human dignity, and only has meaning when shared.*

## 7. Confront injustice, work for an equitable world.
*Never resign yourself. Justice is won through the commitment of all.*

## 8. Be responsible: your actions belong to you.
*No God, no tradition can justify irresponsibility.*

## 9. Care for the world, protect the living and the future.
*Our Earth is a fragile heritage; our destiny is linked to that of all beings.*

## 10. Do good around you, here and now.
*For this is where it all beginsâ€”and where every conscious act can improve the world.*
