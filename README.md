## 🔍 What is Codex Ethica?

**Codex Ethica is a public, collaborative and open-source ethical framework**, based on reason, respect and responsibility — not divine authority.

It aims to offer:
- A clear and rigorous alternative to religious morality
- A foundation for humanist, secular, and civic ethics
- A set of 10 core principles for living ethically without dogma

It draws from the works of thinkers such as **Kant, Camus, Ogien, Nussbaum, Harari, Sen, Jonas**, and many others.

## ✨ Why this project?

Because millions of people live ethical lives without religion — but lack a shared reference.  
Because secularism deserves its own moral voice.  
Because we need ethics that are not inherited, but chosen, debated, and updated.

**Codex Ethica** does not aim to replace religion.  
It offers a public moral framework for those who think differently — but live responsibly.
