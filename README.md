## 🔍 What is Codex Ethica?

**Codex Ethica is a public, collaborative and open-source ethical framework**, based on reason, mutual respect, and shared responsibility — not divine authority.

It aims to provide a robust moral compass for individuals seeking ethical guidance outside of traditional religious doctrines, and for all who wish to contribute to a more just, enlightened, and supportive society. It offers:
- A clear and rigorous alternative to religious morality
- A foundation for humanist, secular, and civic ethics
- A set of 10 core principles for living ethically without dogma

It draws from the works of thinkers such as **Kant, Camus, Ogien, Nussbaum, Harari, Sen, Jonas**, and many others, as well as wisdom from diverse philosophical traditions worldwide.

## 🧭 How to Approach Codex Ethica: Our Reading Guide

To help you discover Codex Ethica, we suggest a progressive approach. Each document plays a role and offers a unique perspective, allowing you to explore the project according to your interests and available time:

1.  **For a quick first look and to grasp the project's spirit:**
    *   We recommend starting with the **[`Manifesto`](/en/manifesto/)**. It outlines our founding call: why and how we envision building a morality without gods. It's the ideal starting point to understand our intentions.

2.  **Practical foundations and their roots:**
    *   Next, familiarize yourself with the **[`Principles`](/en/principles/)**. These Ten Key Principles are designed as a concrete compass for an ethical life.
    *   To understand the detailed philosophical grounding of each of these principles, consult **[`Principles Foundations`](/en/principles_foundations/)**. This document explores their connection to a rich tradition of humanist and critical thought.

3.  **For in-depth exploration and discussion:**
    *   The most comprehensive document is our **[`Philosophy`](/en/philosophy/)**. It lays out the overall theoretical framework of Codex Ethica, explores convergences with various global philosophical traditions, discusses case studies, ethical dilemmas, and proposes a methodology for addressing disagreements. It's a denser read but essential for a thorough understanding.
    *   If you're wondering about common objections or wish to see how this ethic dialogues with critiques, our **[`Objections`](/en/objections/)** offers reasoned responses.

4.  **Further resources and participation:**
    *   Our **[`References`](/en/references/)** lists the bibliography of works and authors inspiring the project, for those who wish to further explore the intellectual sources.
    *   And if you feel like participating in the improvement and dissemination of these texts, our **[`Contributing Guide`](/en/contributing/)** will explain how.

We encourage you to navigate these documents based on your questions. Although they form a coherent whole, each part can also independently illuminate specific aspects.

## ✨ Why this project?

Because millions of people live ethical lives without religion — but lack a shared reference.  
Because secularism deserves its own moral voice.  
Because we need ethics that are not inherited, but chosen, debated, and updated.

**Codex Ethica** does not aim to replace religion.  
It offers a public moral framework for those who think differently — but live responsibly.
